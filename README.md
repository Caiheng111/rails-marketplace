## 1.Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.(R7)
The advent of the mobile Internet era has really begun to make donation and sharing an integral part of our lives,and the era of mobile social welfare is coming.

The power of mobile new Internet is booming in the Chinese public welfare sector. Whether it is the public or the public welfare organizations, the public media has consciously and unconsciously participated in the transformation of China's public welfare undertakings. With the increasing number of media, the Internet era has changed to the era of mobile Internet. The propaganda and dissemination of traditional philanthropy is gradually changing. The philanthropy needs to be more popular and transparent. How can philanthropy be understood by more people and how to adapt to the needs of the current people?

In the traditional way of working, charities will pool the funds raised from individual donors and choose areas that have important value for social development: health, poverty alleviation, culture, etc., responsible for the significance, value, implementation of the project. Assessment and supervision of effects and other aspects. The charity will inform the donor through various channels regarding the project, implementation effect and spending rules it chooses. This way of reviewing donations through intermediaries is not easy to trust the donors.



## 2.Why is it a problem that needs solving?(R8)

The purpose of the Goodgiving is to remove the intermediary. The website itself serves as a donation platform. After the local community government or related agency company publishes the donation project, people can browse directly on the website. The amount of the donation of the website management organization is controlled by everyone. Scope, unlike a donation website, donors do not need to make monthly donations. Goodgiving's donations go out completely and voluntarily. After understanding the specific story and background of the project, the donor class randomly chooses to donate a small amount. Donors can also directly communicate with the organization that initiated the project to learn more about the project and decide whether to make a donation. Without third-party intermediaries, donors are more likely to believe in the authenticity and reliability of donations. Even after learning about the project background, you can register as a voluntee on the website.

I believe that with the promotion of Goodgiving, more and more public welfare projects hope to use the new media to let more power to pay attention to public welfare and promote the development of public welfare. More and more non-profit organizations hope to change the previous official authority image and turn public welfare into a career that everyone can participate in.

The changes brought about by the Goodgiving online donation model are not limited to expanding the source of donations. The high degree of transparency makes the intermediaries almost invisible, allowing the recipients to deal directly with the sponsors. This form of approaching SNS not only allows donors to feel a sense of personal meaning from the freedom of choice, but also allows recipients to feel support from the community rather than a string of numbers added to the account.

## 8.An ERD for your app(R14)

![menua](docs/heng-T2A2-Marketplace-ERD.png)



## 9.Explain the different high-level components (abstractions) in your app(R15)


* ***Rails Routes***
  * In my marketplace, I insert a snippet like the following:, which realy help me save time to write route code
    - resources :line_items
    - resources :carts
    - resources :charities


   * in Rails ultimately gives you the following:
    - get 'charities' => 'charities#index'
    - get 'phocharitiestos/new' => 'charities#new'
    - post 'charities' => 'charities#create'
    - get 'charities/:id' => 'charities#show'
    - get 'charities/:id/edit' => 'charities#edit'
    - patch 'charities/:id' => 'charities#update'
    - delete 'charities/:id' => charities#destroy


* ***Rails’ Action View Form Helper***

    ```txt
      <%= form_with(model: @volunteer, local: true) do |form| %> ......
      created form fields like text_field, text_area, file_field
        made selection boxes
    ```

* ***Rails before_action***
    In each controller I have some before_action calls that check the appropriate level of permissions for a given CRUD operation.for example:

    ```txt
      before_action :set_charity, only:[:edit, :update, :show, :destroy]
      before_action :authenticate_user!, :except => [:listings, :show]
    ```
    ```txt
      before_action :set_line_item, only: [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]
      before_action :set_cart, only: [:create]
      before_action :authenticate_user!
    ```

    ```txt
      before_action :find_conversation
    ```


* ***Rails Active Records(CRUD: Reading and Writing Data)***

 * The rials console provide a very convenient way to access to teh database.For example:
    
    ```txt
      users = User.all
      User.create()
      User.delete_all
      user = User.find_by(name: 'David')
    ```


 * Active Record allows me to validate the state of a model before it gets written into the database.belows are some validations I used in my app:
   
    ```txt
      validates :title, presence: true, length: { minimum: 3, maximum: 50 }
      validates :summary, :challenges, :solution,  presence: true, length: { minimum: 10, maximum: 1000 }
    ```
    ```txt
      validates :name, presence: true, length: { minimum: 3, maximum: 20 }
      validates :description, presence: true, length: { minimum: 10, maximum: 1000 }

      VALID_EMAIL_REGEX = /\A[\w+\-.]+@[a-z\d\-.]+\.[a-z]+\z/i
      validates :email, presence: true, length: { maximum: 105 },
                uniqueness: { case_sensitive: false },
                format: { with: VALID_EMAIL_REGEX }
    ```
    ```txt
      validates_uniqueness_of :sender_id, scope: :recipient_id
    ```
    ```txt
      validates_presence_of :body, :conversation_id, :user_id
    ```


* ***Rails if consition (added in html)***

 * The html.erb file in rails help me make the navbar link changable, for emaple, this if(end) condition can show the different links on navbar when the user logged_in or not.
    
    ```txt
        <% if user_signed_in? && current_user.user_type=="organization" %>
          <% if  current_user.organization !=nil && current_user.organization.title !=nil %>
          <li class="dropdown">
            <a href="#" class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" role="button" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">Welcome Back !<span class="caret"></span></a>
              <ul class="dropdown-menu">
                <li><%= link_to "Post a Project", new_charity_path%> </li> 
                  <li role="separator" class="divider"></li>
                <li><%= link_to "All Projects", charities_path%> </li>
                  <li role="separator" class="divider"></li> 
                <li><%= link_to "Edit Your Profile", edit_organization_path(current_user.organization) %> </li> 
                  <li role="separator" class="divider"></li> 
                <li> <%= link_to "Messages", conversations_path %></li>
              </ul>
              <li><%= link_to "Sign out", destroy_user_session_path, method: :delete %> </li> 
          </li>
          <% else %>
            <li> <%= link_to "Profile", organizations_path %></li>
            <li><%= link_to "Sign out", destroy_user_session_path, method: :delete %> </li> 
          <% end %>
    ```



## 10.Detail any third party services that your app will use(R16)

* ***AWS(S3 buket)***

    1. AWS (Amazon Web Services) has a solution we can use called S3. S3 is for data storage that you can access via a url, which can be usered to store the images in my rails proejct.
